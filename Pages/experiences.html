                        <p>
                            I'm currently studying at UIR, in Rabat, Morroco, in the engineering courses, in
                            the computer science and software engineering department.
                            <br />
                            Not only do we learn technical software, but we also learn to have a strong
                            theoretical and practical understanding of software development principles,
                            algorithms, and design patterns.
                            <br />
                            We work on designing solutions, writing code, and implementing features, as
                            opposed to simply executing tasks using tools and frameworks, this requires a deep
                            understanding of software architecture and design principles.

                            <span class="image left"> <img src="images/SQLI-Logo.png" alt="SQLI" /> </span>The
                            SQLI company, being strongly involved in the field of human resources, must
                            undertake the digitization of all methods currently used to supervise, organize
                            human resources who play an essential role in operations of its agencies. In
                            addition, this digitalization extends to operational teams put in place action to
                            realize its various projects.
                            <br />
                            The fundamental objective of this project is to develop a web application
                            dedicated to human resources management, starting from the basics of the
                            administration of this business. To achieve this objective, I chose to use the UML
                            (Unified Modeling Language) for the analysis and design of the project.

                        <p>
                            I had the chance to do an internship at UIR, The objective of this internship was
                            to develop a web application for the university, that would allow the students to
                            have access to extra courses, to revise for exams.
                            <br />
                            We had to develop the application from scratch, and we had to use the latest
                            technologies, Flutter and firebase, which turned out to be extraodinary tools.

                            I had the incredible opportunity to spend my summer as an observational intern at
                            AttijariWafa Bank, where I delved into the dynamic world of big data and explored
                            the intricacies of the Hadoop ecosystem. As a keen learner, I sought to understand
                            how this cutting-edge technology is leveraged within the banking sector.
                            <br />
                            The observational internship provided a unique lens into the practical
                            applications of the Hadoop ecosystem

                            First 2 years at UIR, in Rabat, Morroco, in the intensive preparation courses, we
                            were taught a lot of things, but most importantly, we were taught about the
                            fundementals of computer science, and how to think like a computer scientist.
                            <br />
                            From fundementals of programming, to data structures and algorithms, to
                            introduction courses, these 2 years opened the doors for me to the world of
                            computer science, and lead me to discover my passion for it.
                            <br />
                            And all thanks to the teachers and administration staff who were always there for
                            us,

                        <p>
                            I obtained my Bacalaureat in 2019, at Afak High School, in Khemisset, Morroco, not
                            to mention that it was a of type Mathematical Sciences A.
                            <br />
                            It was a great experience, and I learned a lot of things, not only about the
                            subjects in particular, but also about myself, and how to manage my time, and how
                            to be more organized.
                            <br />
                            I also learned how to be more social, and how to communicate with people, and how
                            to be more confident in myself.
                            <br />
                            but most importantly, I had the chance to be friends with some of the most amazing
                            people I've ever met, and I'm really grateful for that.
